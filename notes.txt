* Not exposing directly the API feels weird (going through index.php).
On the other hand with an authentication there is no way to forget as everything goes through index.php.

* Everything going through API makes controller pretty useless.
With API only we can have a nice all-purpose modal (maybe 2 with the error one) but the JS would be way bigger and trickier.

* Need to implement installation and get rid of table regeneration.

* Need to implement task priority/order.

* After creating/deleting the way to be on the right page could be better

* Really need to change the last_page mechanics (to be tab friendly)

* attribute types :
	readonly -> only to be read (id, date), the database set/update them automatically
	fixed -> set at creation then is like readonly
	string
	text -> like string but presented with a textarea for multiline texts.
	password -> if left empty will not be updated (hashed so they cannot retrieve previous value when editing)
	int
	float
	double
	boolean
	ReferenceValue -> special case to be able to select from a list of ReferenceValue
	ReferenceValueAny -> special case to be able to select any ReferenceValue (no parent)
	Object/* -> Generic multi choice

* SESSION info :
	user_id
	user_admin -> boolean
	logged
	last_page
	close_noscript
	noscript_message_close
